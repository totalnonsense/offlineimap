This is the Changelog of the maintenance branch.

**NOTE FROM THE MAINTAINER:**
  Contributors should use the `WIP` section in Changelog.draft.rst in order to
  add changes they are working on. I will use it to make the new changelog entry
  on releases. And because I'm lazy, it will also be used as a draft for the
  releases announces.
